The chapter explores the most promising solution methods available and compares their speed and accuracy for some particular economic examples. Except for the simplest dynamic linear models, it is necessary to compute solutions numerically. In estimation contexts, computation speed is important because climbing a likelihood function can require that a model be solved many times. Methods that are faster than direct iterations on the Riccati equation and are more reliable than solutions based on eigenvalue{\textendash}eigenvector decompositions of the state{\textendash}costate evolution equation are discussed in the chapter. Two generalizations are presented in the chapter: The first generalization introduces forcing sequences or ``uncontrollable states'' into the deterministic regulator problem, while the second generalization introduces, among other things, discounting and uncertainty into the augmented regulator problem.},

In this work, we assess whether real business cycle (RBC) and standard medium-scale New Keynesian (NK) models are able to replicate this statistical regularity. We simulate both models, drawing Gaussian- vs Laplace-distributed shocks, and we explore the statistical properties of simulated time series. Our results cast doubts on whether RBC and NK models are able to provide a satisfactory representation of the transmission mechanisms linking exogenous shocks to macroeconomic dynamics.}

Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are the leading tool for making such assessments in an open and transparent manner. We review the state of mainstream DSGE models before the financial crisis and the Great Recession. We then describe how DSGE models are estimated and evaluated. We address the question of why DSGE modelers{\textemdash}like most other economists and policymakers{\textemdash}failed to predict the financial crisis and the Great Recession, and how DSGE modelers responded to the financial crisis and its aftermath. We discuss how current DSGE models are actually used by policymakers.

Fat tails robustly emerge in output growth rates independently of: (i) the way we measure aggregate output; (ii) the family of densities employed in the estimation; (iii) the length of time lags used to compute growth rates.

The dynamic properties of the estimated model are analyzed and shown to match most of the stylized predictions of the model. The estimated decomposition is also used to measure the relative importance of each shock, to interpret some macroeconomic episodes, and to study sources of permanent shocks to nominal variables.}

  abstract = {Combining theoretical models and data in ways unimaginable just a few years ago, open economy macroeconomics has experienced enormous growth over the past several decades. This rigorous and self-contained textbook brings graduate students, scholars, and policymakers to the research frontier and provides the tools and context necessary for new research and policy proposals. Mart{\'i}n Uribe and Stephanie Schmitt-Groh{\'e} factor in the discipline's latest developments, including major theoretical advances in incorporating financial and nominal frictions into microfounded dynamic models of the open economy, the availability of macro- and microdata for emerging and developed countries, and a revolution in the tools available to simulate and estimate dynamic stochastic models. The authors begin with a canonical general equilibrium model of an open economy and then build levels of complexity through the coverage of important topics such as international business-cycle analysis, financial frictions as drivers and transmitters of business cycles and global crises, sovereign default, pecuniary externalities, involuntary unemployment, optimal macroprudential policy, and the role of nominal rigidities in shaping optimal exchange-rate policy. Based on courses taught at several universities, Open Economy Macroeconomics is an essential resource for students, researchers, and practitioners. Detailed exploration of international business-cycle analysis Coverage of financial frictions as drivers and transmitters of business cycles and global crises Extensive investigation of nominal rigidities and their role in shaping optimal exchange-rate policy Other topics include fixed exchange-rate regimes, involuntary unemployment, optimal macroprudential policy, and sovereign default and debt sustainability Chapters include exercises and replication codes.},

  abstract = {The amount of financial data created every day by world stock markets, world governments, financial institutions, and other sources, is increasing at an enormous rate. Economists and financial analysts need tools to manage these large sets of data in a timely and accurate way. Classical linear models of economics have failed to deal with such large amounts of data, and asymptotic theory is the tool that economists have come to rely on for this type of data management. Large sample theory and the fundamental tools of asymptotic theory converge in this thoroughly revised edition of Asymptotic Theory for Econometricians. New material on functional central limit theory and its applications, material on cointegration, and many small points make this Revised Edition a comprehensive and unified treatment of large sample theory. The scope of the book remains the same as that of the First Edition, with sufficient material to fill a full year's course work. This edition also contains updated material on asymptotically efficient instrumental variables estimation, efficient estimation with estimated error covariance matrices, and efficient IV estimation. Exercise solutions have also been updated and expanded. Asymptotic Theory for Econometricians is intended both as a reference for practicing econometricians and financial analysts and as a textbook for graduate students taking courses in econometrics beyond the introductory level. It assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of probability and statistics as well as with calculus and linear algebra, and that the reader also has a good understanding of the classical linear model.},

  abstract = {I use a simple business cycle model to illustrate the workings and limitations of sign restrictions in structural vector autoregressions. Three lessons emerge. First, such sign-based identification is vulnerable to ``shock masquerading'': linear combinations of other shocks may be misidentified as the shock of interest. Second, since the popular Haar prior automatically overweights more volatile shocks, the implied posterior is decisively shaped by relative shock volatilities--a feature of shocks that has nothing to do with their dynamic causal effects. Third, sign restrictions on structural elasticities--rather than just the usual restrictions on impulse responses--can be highly informative.}
