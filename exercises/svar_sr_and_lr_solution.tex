\begin{enumerate}
\item The Federal Reserve Board is assumed to control the interest rate by setting the policy innovation
  after observing the forecast errors for deflator inflation and real GNP growth.
The model is fully identified and includes an aggregate demand shock and an aggregate supply shock in addition to the monetary policy shock.
The monetary policy shock does not affect real GNP either within the current quarter or in the long run.
The only shock to affect the log-level of real GNP in the long run is the aggregate supply shock.

\item[2/3/4] The code might look like this:

Here is the helper function to impose the restrictions:
\lstinputlisting[style=Matlab-editor,basicstyle=\mlttfamily,title=\lstname]{progs/matlab/RWZSRLR_f.m}
An unexpected monetary policy tightening is associated with a persistent decline in real GNP and a rather short-lived response in inflation.
This is an interesting finding considering the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve.
