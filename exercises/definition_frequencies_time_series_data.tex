\section[Definition and Frequencies of Time Series Data]{Definition and Frequencies of Time Series Data\label{ex:DefinitionFrequenciesTimeSeriesData}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Briefly define a time series in terms of random variables and stochastic processes.	
	\item Consider data for various time series given in
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{NorwayGDP.xls}
		\item \texttt{NorwayInterestRate3m.xls} 
		\item \texttt{NorwayInterestRate10yrs.xls}
		\item \texttt{NorwayOSEBXGR.csv}
		\item \texttt{NorwayPopulation.xls}
		\item \texttt{NorwayRealHousePrices.xlsx}
		\item \texttt{NorwayUnemploymentRate.xls}
	\end{itemize}
	Open the individual files and make note of the structure and source of the data.
	Import the data and replicate figure~\ref{fig:NorwayData}.

		\caption{Various Time Series For Norway}\label{fig:NorwayData}
		\end{figure}
   \item What are the data frequencies for each time series?
   For what kind of economic analysis would you use these frequencies?
   \item What are the sample sizes?
   From an economic and/or statistical point of view, is it always better to have a larger sample size?
   \item Roughly speaking, a time series consists of four components: a trend, a cycle, a season, and noise.
   To what extent do you find these features in figure~\ref{fig:NorwayData}?
   \item Consider the plots in figure~\ref{fig:NorwayData} jointly.
   What are possible macroeconomic issues that could be analyzed?
   \item How do you aggregate time series of stock variables (like capital or debt) and of flow variables (like GDP)?
   For example, if you have monthly data, how do you get a quarterly time series?
