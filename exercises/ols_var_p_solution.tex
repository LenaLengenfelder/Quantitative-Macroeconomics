\begin{enumerate}
\item The dimensions are: \(y_t\) is \(K \times 1\), \(Y\) is \(K \times T\), \(u_t\) is \(K \times 1\),
\(U\) is \(K \times T\), \(c\) is \(K \times 1\), \(A_1\) is \(K \times K\), \ldots, \(A_p\) is \(K \times K\),
\(A\) is \(K \times (1+pK)\), \(\alpha\) is \((pK^2+K) \times 1\),
\(Z_{t-1}\) is \((1+pK) \times 1\), \(Z\) is \((Kp+1) \times T\),
\(\Sigma_u\) is \(K \times K\) and \(\Sigma_{\hat{\alpha}}\) is \((pK^2+K) \times (pK^2+K)\).

\item A modified version looks like this.
Note that it also includes OLS estimation of each equation in turn.

\item The OLS estimation of the three variables VAR model might look like this:

The data for Federal Funds Rate as well as the GNP Deflator Inflation do seem to have some trend in it, but nothing serious.
